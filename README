This is meant to be an extremely simple HTTP server for benchmarking Plan 9 and POSIX-compliant operating systems. 

The HTTP parsing and many other parts of the code are based on Paul Griffith's "webserv", being one of the smallest, simplest, and easiest to read HTTP servers I've found online. Like webserv, this server is *not* meant to be used for production in any form, as it utterly lacks any security precautions.
